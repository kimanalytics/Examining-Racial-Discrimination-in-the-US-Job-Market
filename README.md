# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market

## Background
Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.

## Data
In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.
Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer.

## Conclusion
In a group of applicants who get callbacks, with 95% confidence,
- White-sounding names get called back 58.6 - 61.3% of the time; or 60.0 ± 1.4% of the time.
- Black-sounding names get called back 38.7 - 41.4% of the time; or 40.0 ± 1.4% of the time.

## Discussion
However, there are many more factors that should be taken account for callbacks. Just because names-types are correlated with callbacks, it does not mean that causes more or less callbacks. For example, let's take a look at years of experience again.
We see that applicants with more than 10 years of experience get more callbacks compared to people less than 10 years.
